8. **Run Locally:**
    - Now, you can run all APIs on your localhost using Mockoon.

9. **API Usage Instruction:**
    - Test credentials for sign in are: username: "demouser@mail.com" and password: "Test@1234".
    - Username and OTP for forget password are: username: "demouser@mail.com" and OTP: "123456"
    - As we are mocking the request and response using Mockoon. If we are registering a new user with some credentials we are just mocking the response as success. As we don't have any database integrated so It doesn't store a new user anywhere. So we always need to login with our test credentials.

These steps should help you set up Mockoon and run APIs locally. If you have any specific content to paste into the configuration or encounter any issues during the setup, please provide more details for further assistance.
